# stars (v1.0)
**Launch Date:** May 2023

The first of probably not many themes for [my fic website](https://aroceu.com/fic/), due to how ginormous these themes tend to be. Please respect me and don't take too much without crediting me&mdash;this is the most work I've ever put into a website.

The goal of this theme was to feature a color scheme and not overly complicated format in displaying my fics, while allowing the management to be easy for me in the future. I'd been wanting to make a website for my fic for a while, but was daunted with how many fics I knew I'd have to move, as well as the more technical aspects of hosting files &mdash; or databases &mdash; of fic. WordPress was the solution to this management-wise, but thematically I wanted to be able to be flexible with having additional pages, such as an "about" (because I love documentation and talking about myself) and a related works section to showcase the fanart and other recursive works I've received as well :)

The theme's star decoration mostly comes out of convenience and simplicity; I do want to make a 2.0 theme, with custom banners, both for myself and fandoms, eventually. But I also didn't want a graphic that looked too under construction-y, so the repeated star background that I made in Photoshop suits as a cute, but not too underwhelming cosmetic decoration here and there. The focus is on the text, not the design anyway.

## features
- Each fic ("post") is stylized differently from the index page, more reminiscent of a work on Archive of Our Own for easier audience reading. Each fic may have these features, if applicable:
	- Contain a link to bookmark the fic page (on my website) in the user's personal AO3 bookmarks.
	- Includes the link to the AO3 mirror of the fic.
	- Includes a button to access a promo post for the fic on a social media site (currently unusable, as I have privated my Twitter, but may move promo posts to Bluesky and fix this).
	- A link to a related work, similar to AO3 work pages.
	- A notation that the work is a gift for someone and/or part of an event, similar to AO3 work pages.
- Non-fic pages are styled more similarly to the index page.
- Fics can be filtered by any taxonomy applied (tags, ship type, fandom, relationshp category, rating), and can be searched for as well.
- Major fandoms have their own unique banner to take over the main banner, while smaller fandoms don't. This is for the future, where I would like these fandoms to have commissioned art instead.
- Fics tagged as a work-in-progress have a templated note at the end indicating its incompletion.
- Collapsible menu of all fandoms written for, accessible on any non-fic/non-fandom filtered page.
- Night mode, which is toggleable on every page.
- Collapsible menu and filter sidebar on mobile.
- Plugins can be found on the <a href="https://aroceu.com/fic/credits/">credits page</a>.
